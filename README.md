## Synopsis

**P**ersistent **H**omology on **E**mbedded **T**ime-**S**eries

This repository offers high-level tools for exploration and visualization of
* delay coordinate embedding from 1D to 2D
* persistent homology in 2D
and is used to investigate the application of these procedures to signal processing.

Also included is a dataset of time-series (mostly musical instrument recordings) and higher dimensional trajectories in .txt.
3D functionality is under construction.

## Installation

* GCC 5
* popt.h
* ffmpeg (in PATH variable)
